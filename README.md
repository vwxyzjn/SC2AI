# Attempted Reproduction of Deepmindâ€™s StarCraft II Research

## UPDATE on 10/26/19

After two years of getting more into this field of RL research, I realized this reproduction was not even close to the original implementation. I would recommend https://github.com/simonmeister/pysc2-rl-agents as a better reproduction.


You may view the [Jupyter Writeup here](https://costahuang.me/SC2AI/). In this project, we 

* Utilized Openai Gym to interact with Pysc2, the SC II Learning
Environment
* Successfully incorporated Tensorforce, a reinforcement learning
framework, to train SC II game agents
* Constructed maintainable and understandable machine learning
code
