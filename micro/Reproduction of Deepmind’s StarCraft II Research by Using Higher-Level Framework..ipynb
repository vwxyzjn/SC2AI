    "# Reproduction of Deepmindâ€™s StarCraft II Research by Using Higher-Level Framework\n",

    "\n",
    "In early 2017, Google Deepmind introduced a python library [``Pysc2``](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2), the SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment). It provides a interface for RL (Reinforcement Learning) agents to interact with StarCraft 2 by providing the observations and receiving actions. In their paper, Deepmind also described some baseline training algorithms and used them to train agents in [mini-games](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2/blob/master/docs/mini_games.md) such as ``BuildMarines``, ``DefeatRoaches`` and ``MoveToBeacon``<cite data-cite=\"Vinyals2017-ck\"> (Vinyals, 2017)</cite>. Nevertheless, the implementation of the algorithm is not revealed. In this research project, we surveys some reproduction of Deepmind's result and, in the end, we reproduces the results by using higher-level framework (e.g. Tensorforce and gym)."

    "One of the most helpful tutorial is from [Building a Basic PySC2 Agent](https://chatbotslife.com/building-a-basic-pysc2-agent-b109cde1477c) and [Building a Smart PySC2 Agent](https://chatbotslife.com/building-a-smart-pysc2-agent-cdc269cb095d). In the simplest form, you create a class that inherits from ``base_agent.BaseAgent`` and override the ``step()`` function. In essence, the ``step`` function of ``base_agent.BaseAgent`` gives you the observation of current state, including units killed, rewards, and etc, and you need to return an action."
