    "# Reproduction of Deepmindâ€™s StarCraft II Research by Using Higher-Level Framework\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In early 2017, Google Deepmind introduced a python library [``Pysc2``](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2), the SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment). It provides a interface for RL (Reinforcement Learning) agents to interact with StarCraft 2 by providing the observations and receiving actions. In their paper, Deepmind also described some baseline training algorithms and used them to train agents in [mini-games](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2/blob/master/docs/mini_games.md) such as ``BuildMarines``, ``DefeatRoaches`` and ``MoveToBeacon``<cite data-cite=\"Vinyals2017-ck\"> (Vinyals, 2017)</cite>. Nevertheless, the implementation of the algorithm is not revealed. In this research project, we surveys some reproduction of Deepmind's result and found most of their implementation hard to understand and reproduce. In light of this, I reproduces the results by using higher-level framework (e.g. Tensorforce and gym) to enhance maintainability and understandibility."

    "One of the most helpful tutorial is from [Building a Basic PySC2 Agent](https://chatbotslife.com/building-a-basic-pysc2-agent-b109cde1477c) and [Building a Smart PySC2 Agent](https://chatbotslife.com/building-a-smart-pysc2-agent-cdc269cb095d). In the simplest form, you create a class that inherits from ``base_agent.BaseAgent`` and override the ``step()`` function. In essence, the ``step`` function of ``base_agent.BaseAgent`` gives you the observation of current state, including units killed, rewards, and etc, and you need to return an action."

    "Some of the popular (most starred) reproduction repos are but not limited to:\n",
    "* [pysc2-examples](https://github.com/chris-chris/pysc2-examples)\n",
    "* [pysc2-agents](https://github.com/xhujoy/pysc2-agents)\n",

    "Unfortunately, most of the implementation are very hard to understand. Common issues includes \n",
    "\n",
    "* Unconventional project setup\n",
    "    * For example, ``pysc2-examples``, one of the most starred reproduction, does not follow the typical python project structure defined [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#initial-files). As a result, it seems that one can only use Pycharm to run the project.\n",
    "* Poor documentation\n",
    "    * For example, ``sc2aibot`` only provides a documentation for the [agent parameters](https://github.com/pekaalto/sc2aibot/blob/master/actorcritic/agent.py), and all the other functions are left undocumented. Because of this, it's even hard to figure out how the observation is passed to the model.\n",
    "* Tight coupling/ Large functions\n",
    "    * For example, ``pysc2-RLagents`` use [one giant file](https://github.com/greentfrapp/pysc2-RLagents/blob/master/Agents/PySC2_A3C_AtariNet.py) to include \"everything\" (the training, runing, reacting components of the algorithm). Deeply nested loop and condition are ubiquitous and, as a result, the author's work is almost unreadable. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Nonetheless, I would like to point out that ``sc2aibot`` is probably the best out of those repos. Unlike other repos,  ``sc2aibot`` almost reproduces most of the Mini-games and shows a decent results compared to Deepmind's results:\n",
